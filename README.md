# Final-Project
It should be noted that the code that is needed to run my project is in a folder
called FinalProject, I apolgize for this, when I went to re-read the requirements 
it was too late to change the folder name. The data sets that I will need
for the app are here as well, they are called CD_by_year, and CSsymptoms respectively

#this is my proposal
1) Olusewa Obadiya

2) Syphillis and Pre-natal Health

3) A shiny app

4) Allow people to explore the statistics surroundng std’s and the impact it has on fetuses

5) I will be using Public Use Data sets from the CDC concerning syphillis rates among various populations from 2013 to 2022

6) The main feature of the app will be attractive graphs that allow people to explore the data from diffferent years. They will answer the questions of: what was the syphillis rate that year, what was the syphillis rate among infants, and how these rates have changed over time

7) I aim to allow users to generate different graphs by selecting or excluding certain variables, so that they can focus on the part of the data that is relavant to them. 

8) I suspect that I will have the most truble programming the graphs so that users can select or deselect certain variables. 

9) I am working by myself

FINAL DOCUMENTATION
a.The explosion of Congenital Syphillis and its consequences
b. The main purpose of my project is to examine data pertaining to congenital syphillis and its consequences over the last 10 years.

c. My app is available on github. My code is available for cloning, and the two data files that are used in the app are in the git hub repository as well.

d. My data source is the CDC. Go to the following link(https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2022/default.htm) , and then click the “Data Points” button on the page will download a folder of excel files pertaining to STI surveillance. I chose two data sets for the project. 

e. The app has line graphs that demonstrate either syphillis cases among women aged 15-44 or congenital syphilis cases. It also has several bar graphs that allows one to see te outcome of congenital syphillis cases. They answer the questions of how the frequency of syhphils gas changed over time, and what the consequences of that change are.

g. There were two interactive graphs in the project. The first interactive graph allowed users to get an overview of two meausres over the same time period: Syphillis cases among women aged 15-44 and congenital syphilis cases. The other intercative graph offered a more granualr, year by year overview of one meausre: What is the outcome of the congenital syohilis cases. Using these elements is pretty straightforwad. For the first graph there is a drop down menu where you can choose Syphillis cases among women or congenital syphillis cases. The other graph also has a dropdown menu where one can select the year.

h. I had great difficulty in getting the graphs to react too changes in the data selection. Either the graph would not load at all, or for example: one could choose a different year and the graph would not change.

1. I worked alone, but I also sought help from the professors when it came to some elements.

j. There were some data sets from the CDC that were concerned with the STI rate across different states. If i had more time, I would have sought to create an interactive map as well.
