# Final-Project
#this is my proposal
1) Olusewa Obadiya

2) Syphillis and Pre-natal Health

3) A shiny app
4)   First there will be an overview option graph - It will eoncompass the years 2014-2022 and people will be able to choose a CS graph or a syphiliis rate among women 15-44 graph
5)   Underneath, there should be an graph encompasses the years 2018-2022 focuing on the outcomes of CS, people should be ablt to choose still birth, etc
6)   Ask- can you see the explosion? for the first graph, and say aftermath of the explosion for the second graph

7) Allow people to explore the statistics surroundng stdâ€™s and the impact it has on fetuses

8) I will be using Public Use Data sets from the CDC concerning syphillis rates among various populations from 2013 to 2022

9) The main feature of the app will be attractive graphs that allow people to explore the data from diffferent years. They will answer the questions of: what was the syphillis rate that year, what was the syphillis rate among infants, and how these rates have changed over time

10) I aim to allow users to generate different graphs by selecting or excluding certain variables, so that they can focus on the part of the data that is relavant to them. 

11) I suspect that I will have the most truble programming the graphs so that users can select or deselect certain variables. 

12) I am working by myself
