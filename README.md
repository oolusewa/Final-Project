# Final-Project
It should be noted that the code that is needed to run my project is in a folder
called FinalProject, I apolgize for this, when I went to re-read the requirements 
it was too late to change the folder name. The data sets that I will need
for the app are here as well, they are called CD_by_year, and CSsymptoms respectively

#this is my proposal
1) Olusewa Obadiya

2) Syphillis and Pre-natal Health

3) A shiny app

4) Allow people to explore the statistics surroundng stdâ€™s and the impact it has on fetuses

5) I will be using Public Use Data sets from the CDC concerning syphillis rates among various populations from 2013 to 2022

6) The main feature of the app will be attractive graphs that allow people to explore the data from diffferent years. They will answer the questions of: what was the syphillis rate that year, what was the syphillis rate among infants, and how these rates have changed over time

7) I aim to allow users to generate different graphs by selecting or excluding certain variables, so that they can focus on the part of the data that is relavant to them. 

8) I suspect that I will have the most truble programming the graphs so that users can select or deselect certain variables. 

9) I am working by myself
